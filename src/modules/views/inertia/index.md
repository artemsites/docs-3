# Inertia JS

From the [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) docs:

> Inertia is a new approach to building classic server-driven web apps. We call it the modern monolith.

> Inertia allows you to create fully client-side rendered, single-page apps, without the complexity that comes with modern SPAs. It does this by leveraging existing server-side patterns that you already love.

Leaf MVC and Leaf API come with built-in support for Inertia.js. This means you can build amazing frontend applications using Inertia.js and Leaf.
